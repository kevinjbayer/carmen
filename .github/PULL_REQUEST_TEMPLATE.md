Before submitting a PR that modifies geographical data, please read the [Wiki on how to do this properly](https://github.com/carmen-ruby/carmen/wiki/Contributing-Data). This will save everyone a lot of time, and get your PR merged quicker!

For non-trivial PRs, please add an entry to the CHANGELOG (following the convention in place).

If the changes are geography related (overlay/locale modifications) place the entry under "Geographic Modifications".

Please follow this format _exactly_:

`[#<pr-number>] <PR description _without_ an ending period> ([@<github-handle>](<github-profile>))`

__Please replace the text above with a summary of your changes__

* [ ] I have read the [Wiki on how to make geographic changes](https://github.com/carmen-ruby/carmen/wiki/Contributing-Data) if this PR modifies geographic data
